# Project Nomad

This repo is going to document my journey towards building my own Star Trek Nomad probe.

## Overview
Being a kid and Star Trek fan in the late 70’s wasn’t easy. I grew up with 2 TV channels. I had to catch reruns of the original Star Trek series at 1:00am on Saturday nights. I’ve always been enamored with the episode: “The Changeling”

Star Trek is what lit my spark of interest for Electrical Engineering. Nomad was the icing on the cake.
