# Project Nomad ![Nomad](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-brainstorming-8A2BE2)

This repo is going to document my journey towards building my own Star Trek Nomad probe.

* [Brainstorming and Design](#brainstorming-and-design)

## Overview
If you’re a fan of the original Star Trek series, then you’re familiar with Nomad. It appeared in the episode: "The Changeling".

Nomad was an old earth space probe which encountered another alien space probe, and merged with it. In the process, its programming was corrupted, and it evolved into a genocidal killing machine, with an imperative to destroy all "biological infestations" it deems to be imperfect.

Captain Kirk and his crew did eventually defeat Nomad in the end.

Star Trek and Nomad led me to pursuing my degree in Electrical Engineering.
