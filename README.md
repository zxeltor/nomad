# Project Nomad ![Nomad](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-brainstorming-8A2BE2)

This repo is going to document my journey towards building my own Star Trek Nomad probe.

## Overview
Being a kid and Star Trek fan in the late 70’s wasn’t easy. I grew up with 2 TV channels. I had to catch reruns of the original Star Trek series at 1:00am on Saturday nights. I’ve always been enamored with the episode: “The Changeling”

Star Trek and Nomad led me to Electrical Engineering.
